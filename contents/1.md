Hey there, reader!

Welcome to **git-push blog**, a space where developers can share their experience, learnings, tips and tricks with coding.

This is an open space, everyone is welcome, every idea is valued and every contribution is celebrated!

As the creator of this platform, I have one wish for it - that brilliant minds will come and contribute with their own writings. 

There is no deadline, no need for regular publishing: just fun and enjoyable time in writing and contributing.

If you are interested, the only thing you need to do is to create a fork of [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/AstraBert/git-push-blog), check out a new branch, write a post, commit and push it and open a pull request.

Once the PR is in, a review will come soon to approve your contribution!

Hopefully everything is clear and, if you wish to reach out to me, you can do so on [one of my social platforms](https://link.clelia.dev).
